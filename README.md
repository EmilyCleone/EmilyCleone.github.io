This is my personal Portfolio. I have used HTML, CSS, and Javascript within the code. SCSS is a language I plan to better understand and learn which is also included in this code. 
Within my portfolio I have links to my previous work from the Coding Bootcamp, a contact page, and info about me. I am continuing to work on this portfolio has my skills enhance to make it more my own and complete.
